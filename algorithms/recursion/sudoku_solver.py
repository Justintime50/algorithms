SUDOKU

Definition: A Sudoku puzzle solver that uses recursion. Sudoku is a 9x9 grid that requires you to
enter numbers where each cell is filled but there are no repeats between the numbers in the same
column, row, or box

Usage: venv/bin/python algorithms/recursion/sudoku_solver.py

Lessons Learned:
1) The only way this works is if you use back tracking and recursion, otherwise you'll get to
a dead end and cannot continue. Backtracking and recursion will help when we hit a dead end
2) Recursion and returning from recursion is tricky. You must properly return from a recursive
function or risk getting `NoneType` on the return, additionally, you want to make sure you return
at the right place so you don't have an eternal loop and your recursion can move on.
